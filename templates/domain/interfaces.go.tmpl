// Package domain contains core business contracts used across the application.
//
// File: interfaces.go
//
// This file defines core interfaces (e.g., services, repositories) that represent
// the business contracts in the system. These interfaces are implemented by modules
// in the /internal/* packages.
//
// Purpose:
// - Decouple domain logic from implementation.
// - Allow for flexible module wiring and easy mocking during testing.
// - Centralize business contracts for better maintainability.
//
// Note:
// - This file only contains interface definitions.
// - Implementation must reside outside the domain layer.
