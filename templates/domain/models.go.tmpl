// Package domain defines core business models shared across the application.
//
// File: models.go
//
// This file contains core entity and value object definitions used in the domain layer.
// These models represent the structure and rules of the business data, and are intended
// to be used by services, repositories, and handlers throughout the application.
//
// Purpose:
// - Define canonical data structures (e.g., User, Product, Order, etc.).
// - Serve as a source of truth for business entities.
// - Keep logic-free, strictly for data representation.
//
// Note:
// - Models here should not depend on infrastructure or external packages (e.g., database, HTTP).
// - Use plain Go structs with domain-specific naming.
// - Validation or behavior should be added via methods **only if it's part of domain logic**
